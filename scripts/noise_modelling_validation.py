# This script file tunes the sigma hyperparameter used in the Parzen-Rosenblatt window method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation).
# The tuning of this hyperparameter is performed using both the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence)
# and the Bhattacharyya distance (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhattacharyya_distance). 
# The results of the experiment are stored in a csv file, which includes the optimal value of sigma to approximate the PDF of the background RM images' noise and 
# the image that it is related to.
# Several plots are generated to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the results of the algorithm, as well as log files containing the execution details.
# The user may set some global environments for the script, such as OUTPUT_FILE, which contains the path to the results of the script.
