# SMORE: Synthetic Multi-Orientation Resolution Enhancement

This code was developed by Remedios et al. for the paper "[Self-Supervised Super-Resolution for Anisotropic MR Images with and Without Slice Gap](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-44689-4_12)". I do not own this code, and will use it for research pourposes, all credit goes to the authors.
