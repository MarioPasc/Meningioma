"""
This script contains all the functions that perform the estimation of isotrophic and anisotrophic MRI noise
by fitting covariance models to variograms generated following a preferred direction (anisotrophic) or with
any direction (isotrophic).

These functions include:
    1. Computing the isotrophic variogram
    2. Computing the anisotrophic variogram -given various directions to focus. 
    3. Finding the best-fitting covariance model from a list. This selection is based on the R^2 obtained by the model. 
    4. Getting the final noise volume or noise map in 2d.

    """
    Generate synthetic Gaussian random field noise for a 2D image.

    Two modes are available:

      1. **independent=True** (default):
         Two independent 2D Gaussian random fields (representing the real and imaginary parts)
         are generated using gs.SRF with a "structured" mesh. The final noise is computed as:

             noise = sqrt(real_field^2 + imag_field^2)

         The use of two independent seeds ensures that the two fields are generated independently.

      2. **independent=False**:
         A single 3D Gaussian random field is generated over a volume of shape (n, m, 2)
         using gs.SRF with a "structured" mesh. The two slices along the third dimension are then
         extracted as the real and imaginary parts and combined via the modulus operation:

             noise = sqrt(slice_0^2 + slice_1^2)

         In this case the two channels are correlated as they come from one 3D realization.

    **Mesh Type Considerations:**
    When using gs.SRF, the `mesh_type` parameter determines how the input coordinate tuple is interpreted.
    With `"structured"`, the provided arrays (or ranges) define the grid along each axis, which is ideal
    for regularly spaced images or volumes. For irregular grids one might use `"unstructured"`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : gs.CovModel
        The best-fit covariance model to be used for generating the noise.
    shape : Tuple[int, int]
        A tuple (n, m) defining the size of the 2D image.
    independent : bool, optional
        If True (default), generate two independent 2D fields (using separate seeds).
        If False, generate one 3D field of shape (n, m, 2) and extract two slices.
    seed_real : int, optional
        Random seed for the real part (used if independent is True).
    seed_imag : int, optional
        Random seed for the imaginary part (used if independent is True).
    seed_3d : int, optional
        Random seed for the 3D field (used if independent is False).

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, np.ndarray]
        A tuple (real_field, imag_field, combined_field) where each array has shape (n, m).
        The combined field is computed as sqrt(real_field**2 + imag_field**2).
